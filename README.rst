**Productivity for system functional specification**

Progress
================================================================================================

* Feb. 18, 2021 - Expressing initial need and answer proposition
  

Overview
================================================================================================

In the context of the growing complexity of multi-domain systems, such as aeronautic or rail systems, 
the need for a better *traceability*, *completeness* and *validation* of functional specification has increased.
This is the opportunity to provide better design *tools* for system engineers and better *information systems* for project management.
This project aims at specifying a description language and associated tools going in that direction.

Needs
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The need for better system specification tools can be split in severals key points:

* Behavior design and validation tools
* Guidelines and consistency checkers
* Integrated development environnement
* Modern version control and traceability

Features
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Considering the needs expressed above, the following features are in the scope of this project:

* Core model to represent arithmetics, formal logic, linear and functional algebra
* Core model to represent physical units and dimensions
* Data model representing the inputs and outputs of the system
* Data model representing the concepts of the system and their relationships
* Processing model to simulate and test the behavior of the systems
* Processing model to validate semantic, orthographic and syntactic
* Processing model to produce human readable output documents

The main goal being to provide a *description language* that is able to represent the data models,
*applications* that can perform processing using that language and *libraries* that supports applications development.

**Note** Preferred programming language for the project will be the `Rust <https://www.rust-lang.org/>`_, except for the GUI parts.
